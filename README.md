# repo-context

`repo-context` is a portable skill for code agents working in large, legacy, or weakly documented repositories.

It builds a repo-local context pack so an agent can orient itself, scope work before deep file reads, and refresh that knowledge after code changes.
The architecture is language-agnostic: a generic scan core generates modules, hotspots, and repo briefs, while language-aware analyzers only contribute optional hints.

## Compatibility

This repository follows the open [`SKILL.md`](https://github.com/anthropics/agent-skills-standard) pattern used across modern agent tooling. The packaged skill is designed to be usable anywhere that supports repository-scoped skills or promptable skill folders.

It is intended for tools and directories that support portable skills, including Agent Skills Standard-compatible environments and similar agent runtimes.

## Included Skill

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `repo-context` | Build and maintain a progressive repo context pack with repo maps, module briefs, hotspot briefs, drift checks, and task scoping. |

## What It Generates

By default, `repo-context` writes a progressive context pack to `.repo-context/` inside the target repository:

```text
.repo-context/
├── index.md
├── repo-map.md
├── modules/*.md
├── files/*.md
├── symbol-map.json
└── manifest.json
```

The output directory can be overridden with `--out` when the host agent or project already has a preferred memory or artifacts directory.

## Why It Exists

Large repositories usually break agent quality in the same ways:

- too many implementation files get loaded at once
- architecture knowledge only exists in code, not reusable summaries
- legacy services have to be rediscovered before every change
- multi-file refactors make earlier context stale

`repo-context` adds a lightweight knowledge layer before implementation reads so agents can work progressively instead of reading the whole repository up front.

## When To Use It

- onboarding into an unfamiliar codebase
- planning non-trivial multi-file work
- tracing legacy services before changes
- generating a repo map or hotspot analysis
- refreshing architecture context during refactors

## Installation

### Skills CLI

```bash
npx skills add chokwinlee/repo-context --skill repo-context
```

### Manual

Copy `skills/repo-context/` into the local or project skill directory used by your agent.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chokwinlee/repo-context.git
cp -R repo-context/skills/repo-context /path/to/<agent-skills-dir>/repo-context
```

## Usage

Typical workflow:

1. bootstrap repository context
2. check whether the pack is stale
3. scope the task against the generated map and briefs
4. read only the recommended modules and files
5. refresh after broad edits

Example prompts:

- `Bootstrap repo context for this repository, then tell me which modules matter for adding Stripe billing.`
- `Refresh repo context, then scope a fix for the legacy reporting endpoint.`
- `Before planning a refactor of the export pipeline, generate a repo map and hotspot briefs.`
- `Bootstrap repo context, then scope the files involved in verifying a Python webhook signature.`

Important behavior:

- Bare `rg` and `rg --files` respect `.gitignore`, so they are not a reliable source of truth for repo-wide discovery.
- The `repo-context` scan intentionally looks past root `.gitignore` so generated or untracked implementation files can still appear in the context pack when they matter.
- Project-local analyzer auto-discovery under `repo-context/analyzers/` still respects ignored paths, so hidden experimental analyzers do not load accidentally.

## CLI Quick Start

```bash
python3 skills/repo-context/scripts/repo_context.py bootstrap --root /path/to/repo
python3 skills/repo-context/scripts/repo_context.py check --root /path/to/repo --fail-on-stale
python3 skills/repo-context/scripts/repo_context.py task-scope --root /path/to/repo --query "add png export to the editor"
python3 skills/repo-context/scripts/repo_context.py refresh --root /path/to/repo
python3 skills/repo-context/scripts/repo_context.py bootstrap --root /path/to/repo --out .agent-context/repo-context
python3 skills/repo-context/scripts/post_edit_refresh.py --root /path/to/repo --file /path/to/edited-file
```

For immediate freshness after every code edit, use a host-level post-edit hook that runs `post_edit_refresh.py`.
Git hooks are still useful at commit or merge boundaries, but they cannot guarantee recalculation after each local write.

## Repository Layout

```

The published skill lives at `skills/repo-context`.

## Architecture

- Generic scan core: file inventory, role classification, module detection, hotspot scoring, drift checks, and deterministic rendering.
- Analyzer layer: a registry of file analyzers and project-hint analyzers contributes symbols, dependency edges, entrypoint hints, and ecosystem hints without changing the output contract.
- Main scan behavior: tracked repo files are discovered independently of root `.gitignore`, so the context pack can cover generated or otherwise hidden source when needed.
- Local extension discovery: project analyzers are auto-loaded from `repo-context/analyzers/` when that directory is present and not ignored.
- Stable outputs: `index.md`, `repo-map.md`, module briefs, hotspot briefs, `symbol-map.json`, and `manifest.json`.

See `skills/repo-context/references/architecture.md` for the design split and extension model.

## Local Validation

```bash
python3 skills/repo-context/scripts/test_repo_context.py
python3 skills/repo-context/scripts/post_edit_refresh.py --root /path/to/repo --file /path/to/repo/some-file.py
python3 -m py_compile skills/repo-context/scripts/repo_context.py skills/repo-context/scripts/post_edit_refresh.py skills/repo-context/scripts/test_repo_context.py skills/repo-context/scripts/lib/*.py
```

## Current Scope

`repo-context` is generic by design. It currently ships analyzers for JS/TS, Python, and Ruby, plus manifest-based project hints for Node, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, and PHP repositories. Repositories outside those analyzers still get the generic context-pack workflow through directory, role, hotspot, and module heuristics.
